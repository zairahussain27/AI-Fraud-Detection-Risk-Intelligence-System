# 🔐 AI Fraud Detection & Risk Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Fraud Detection & Risk Intelligence System** is a real-world data analytics project designed to simulate how banks and fintech companies detect fraudulent transactions and manage financial risk.

This system analyzes transaction data, identifies suspicious patterns, predicts fraud probability, assigns risk scores, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard for decision-makers.

The goal is to build a practical, business-focused solution that demonstrates strong analytical thinking, SQL expertise, machine learning application, and dashboard reporting — similar to real industry fraud analytics systems.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions face major losses due to:

* fraudulent transactions
* stolen cards
* suspicious payments
* bot activity

They need intelligent systems that can:

* detect fraud early
* flag high-risk transactions
* reduce financial loss
* support decision-making

This project builds a mini version of such a system.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

* Analyze transaction patterns and identify fraud trends
* Build a fraud prediction model using machine learning
* Assign risk scores to transactions and customers
* Create a decision-based risk classification system
* Design an interactive dashboard for fraud monitoring
* Provide explanation for why transactions are flagged

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Programming & Analysis**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)

**Visualization & Dashboard**

* Power BI

**Supporting Tools**

* Excel (data review & preprocessing)
* Git & GitHub

**Machine Learning**

* Logistic Regression / Random Forest (Fraud prediction)

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

Realistic financial transaction dataset containing:

* transaction amount
* customer details
* time & location
* fraud labels

### 2. Data Analysis (EDA)

* Fraud distribution analysis
* High-risk locations
* Time-based fraud patterns
* Customer behavior trends

### 3. Feature Engineering

Created analytical features such as:

* transaction frequency
* unusual transaction amount
* time-based risk indicators
* customer risk patterns

### 4. Fraud Prediction Model

Machine learning model predicts:

> probability of transaction being fraudulent

### 5. Risk Scoring System

Transactions categorized into:

* High Risk
* Medium Risk
* Low Risk

### 6. Dashboard & Insights

Interactive dashboard showing:

* fraud trends
* total loss amount
* high-risk transactions
* risk by location/time
* actionable insights

---

## 📊 Expected Outcome

A complete fraud intelligence system that:

* detects suspicious transactions
* predicts fraud probability
* assigns risk levels
* provides business insights
* supports decision-making

---

## 🚀 Status
